This app is currently in development!

## Description
This fullstack app allows a user to track their daily calories and macros (protein, fat, carbs) consumed in a day.
The app tracks the daily weight and calories consumed, allowing the user to determine whether they need to adjust their diet at all. The app allows the user to calculate their TDEE to make better informed descisions regarding how much
they should eat. A "recipe inspiration" page provides recipes that meet the ingredient and calorie requirements
specified by the user.
